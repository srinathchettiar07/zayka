            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Zayka is a home-made food and handicraft delivery platform designed to empower homemakers, especially women, by giving them the opportunity to share their culinary and creative talents with the world. From crispy pappads of the South, spicy pickles from Andhra, to melt-in-the-mouth laddoos from Punjab—Zayka brings the authentic taste of Indian households to your plate.</p>
            
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Through Zayka, users can explore the diverse taste of India, connecting with regional cuisines and timeless recipes you won't find in restaurants. Every dish tells a story—of a grandmother's secret masala, a mother's lovingly prepared snack, or a festive treat passed down through generations. It's not just food—it's emotion, culture, and comfort on a plate.</p>
